How does this impact performance?\n- Modify function to take comparator function. specify default if not provided (check out native Array.sort comparator function for reference)\n- Use your comparator function to verify that your sort is stable by taking input: [{value: 15}, {value: 10, order: 1}, {value: 10, order: 2}]\n- Implement selection sort for a linked list (you can use your data structure implemention from earlier in the course). How does this impact performance and stability?\n*/\n\nvar test = require('ava')\n\ntest('implement selection sort')\n"]}
